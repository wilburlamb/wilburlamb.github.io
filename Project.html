    <h1>Aims</h1>
    <p>The aim of this project is to assess the micro and macroeconomic costs and benefits of hosting, sponsoring, and participating in, the FIFA World Cup. </p>
        <p>With over half of the world's population expected to tune in to the 2022 edition of the tournament, the economic outcomes of such a global spectacle are widespread.</p>

<!--Data Section-->
    <div class="section2">
    <h1>Data</h1> 
    <p>For this project I have used a variety of data.</p> 

    <p>I have downloaded csv files from the World Bank for GDP and tourism figures, as well as FIFA data via Kaggle. In each case I have used pandas in Python via Google Colab to clean the data and convert it into long form to make it easier to chart.</p>
        
    <p>I have also used Yahoo Finance's Python package to access stock prices, using loops to download the data as csv. Subsequently, I utilised a hierarchical clustering machine learning technique to cluster the stock prices in order to make visual comparisons between the behaviour of sponsor stocks possible.</p>
        
    <p>The other technique I have utilised is scraping tables from the internet. I have scraped Wikipedia, thesoccrerworldcups.com, and totalsportal.com, for data on historic costs to hosts, World Cup success, and prize funds respectively. Once again I used pandas to clean the scraped tables.</p> 
        
    <p>Importantly, because my focus is on historic World Cups I have avoided the use of APIs. I also found that storing my data in GitHub avoided the chance of charts crashing. Moreover, I struggled to find APIs with data relating to the World Cup.

        <!--Hosting Conclusions-->
        <h3>Hosting - Conclusions</h3>
        <p>My first two charts show that the cost of hosting the World Cup is rising, both in nominal terms and relative to GDP. This means that nations putting in bids to host must consider the cost to the taxpayer now more than ever. Furthermore, my second chart, including Qatar 2022, shows how unprecedented government spending on this year's tournament has been. Is Qatar an anomaly or the new status quo? </p>


            <p>Whilst costs are rising for hosts, there are still benefits on and off the pitch.</p>

            
                <p>My FIFA ranking index shows a drop off in form in the build-up to a nation’s home games, followed by an improvement on the pitch in the years following. Whilst there is a positive trend in ranking during the four years surrounding tournament, the 8-year trend is less positive, with only two nations being ranked higher at the end of this period than the start.</p>

            
                    <p>Off the pitch, one of the commonly cited reasons for hosting a World Cup is increased tourism. My index of tourism receipts supports this idea - tourism revenue increases most significantly in the year of the World Cup. Whilst this positive trend continued in Germany and South Africa, total receipts dropped in the subsequent year in Brazil and Russia.</p>

            
                        <p>Overall, whilst the short-term benefits of hosting are obvious, the long run drop off in tourism receipts and FIFA ranking, combined with rapidly increasing costs, suggest hosting may not always be a viable long-term economic strategy.

        <!--Sponsoring Conclusions -->
        <h3>Sponsoring - Conclusions</h3>
        <p>To assess the microeconomic impact of sponsoring the World Cup, I have selected four publicly limited sponsors with World Cup partnerships of at least 20 years - Coca Cola, McDonalds, Budweiser, and Adidas.</p>

            <p>Throughout this World Cup year, the sponsor stocks have exhibited some similarities. Notably, Budweiser and Adidas stock prices have been highly correlated through 2022, with a bivariate regression garnering a statistically significant R-squared value of 0.7. However, regressions of all other pairings of stocks showed no sign of linear relationships.</p>
            
                <p>My chart made using hierarchical clustering supports the regression in showing an almost year-long correlation between Budweiser and Adidas. There was also a positive trend in all four stock prices during the month leading up to the World Cup (late October to early November 2022), which can likely be explained by the companies’ sponsorship deals resulting in higher brand exposure during this period.</p>
                <p>This leads me to conclude that sponsoring the world cup is an effective short-term strategy for firms.</p>

        <!--Participating and Winning Conclusions-->
        <h3>Participaiting and Winning - Conclusions</h3>
        <p>My first chart shows an exponential growth in the World Cup prize fund, from its introduction in 1982, to the present day. With the total prize fund, as well as the rewards for winning and participating, having increased dramatically over the years, the incentive for nations to qualify for the tournament is greater than ever.</p>

            <p>Moreover, as my second chart illustrates, there is little relationship between World Cup success and GDP per capita. This means the incentive for poorer nations to invest in their World Cup campaigns is certainly worthwhile. The combination of larger prizes for qualified nations, as well as the possibility of success even for less wealthy countries, makes the economic benefits of participating and winning huge.
